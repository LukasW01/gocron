# gocron 

A simple golang wrapper over github.com/robfig/cron and os/exec as a cron replacement. Additionally the application opens a HTTP port that can be used as a healthcheck. 

## Getting Started

Install the dependencies:

```bash
go get .
```

Usage:

```bash
go run ./main.go -s "* * * * *" -p 8080 -i -- /bin/bash -c "echo 1;"
```

Check the healthcheck:

```
$ curl -v localhost:8080
* Rebuilt URL to: localhost:8080/
* Hostname was NOT found in DNS cache
*   Trying ::1...
* Connected to localhost (::1) port 8080 (#0)
> GET / HTTP/1.1
> User-Agent: curl/7.37.1
> Host: localhost:8080
> Accept: */*
>
< HTTP/1.1 200 OK
< Content-Type: application/json
